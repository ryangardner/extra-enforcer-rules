Require Encoding
  
  This rule checks if files have the required character encoding.
  
  The rule can be configured with the following parameters:
  
*--+--+
| <<encoding>> | the required encoding |
|                        | default is <<<$\{project.build.sourceEncoding\}>>> | 
*--+--+
| <<includes>> | Comma (or pipe) separated list of globs to include. |
*--+--+
| <<excludes>> | Comma (or pipe) separated list of globs to exclude. | 
*--+--+
| <<useDefaultExcludes>> | exclude known file patterns for source control systems or backup files, |
*--+--+
| <<failFast>> | if true, the rule fails after the first violation, otherwise a list of violations is |  
|              | accumulated and a violation is issued with a list of files.                          |
*--+--+
